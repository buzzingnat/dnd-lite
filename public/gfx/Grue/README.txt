My interpretation of a grue. If you do not know what a Grue is, then your deprived.

I wasn't exactly sure which version was the best so I'm going to upload all of them. I think I prefer the bloody without the grin though.

Includes:

-Standard

-Standard with a grin

-Bloody

-Bloody with a grin

 

Not sure if I need to mention but, I started with the hood from the ghost in this by  RedShrike. 

But It was more of an inspiration if anything, I barely used it.

 

UPDATE 1: Added different facing directions.
